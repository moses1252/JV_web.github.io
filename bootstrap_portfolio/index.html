        <h3 class="text-warning">About Me</h3>
        <p> 
          I am a fourth year undergraduate student at California State University, Los Angeles. I am earning my Bachelor’s Degree in Spanish. I aspire to pursue a Master’s Degree in Communicative 
          Disorders with an emphasis in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP). I started my first year at CalStateLA pursuing a dream to go to Medical School to become a Pediatrician due to my interest 
          in Science and my love for children. I began my first job at 17 years-old as an LA County Pool Lifeguard. This occupation gave me insight on what it was like to work with children, as well 
          as a taste of the importance of being prepared to save a life if the time came. I took an “Introduction to Communicative Disorders” class which is where I became deeply interested in the 
          field. My love for language, science, and children combined into one occupation. Now I am paving a new path for myself. My native language is Spanish, but I was raised and born in California
          so I speak fluent English. My admiration for language has pushed me to learn American Sign Language.I want to expand my knowledge with languages, therefore I am currently learning Elementary
          Chinese (Mandarin). I believe it is important to go above and beyond to become an SLP. Growing up in East Los Angeles, I have enough experience to understand that it is vital to know both 
          English and Spanish to be able to communicate with my community. I believe speaking multiple languages can help me broaden my scope of practice. My school involvement consists of a few clubs.
          At first, I joined the I AM PRE-MED club when I started college. Then I joined the Association of Computing Machinery club. I did this because Computer Science peaked my interest. I found
          that the major is a male-dominated industry. I now advocate and push for females to choose Computer Science. Fortunately, my efforts encouraged my sister, who will be joining CalStateLA
          Fall 2021, to be a Computer Science major. As a work-study student I worked a few jobs on campus. First, I worked as an office assistant for the Center for Engagement, Service, and the
          Public Good. There, resided programs like the Project Rebound program, the Jumpstart program, and the America Reads & Counts program. Later, I became a program assistant for the
          Jumpstart program. I currently work as a Community Representative at Lincoln High School; a beautiful diverse public school where I am able to put my language skills into practice.
